				<p>
					I made the platform end-to-end using a robust and scalable stack. The frontend was developed using Next.js, React.js and
					TailwindCSS, offering a responsive, highly performant interface that ensures seamless accessibility across devices. The
					user experience was further enhanced by integrating Utho for real-time session replays, user heatmaps, and
					analytics-driven UI improvements.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the backend, I implemented scalable APIs using Next.js API routes and managed data persistence through Prisma ORM
					connected to a PostgreSQL database. This setup provided the flexibility and performance needed to support thousands of
					users concurrently while maintaining data integrity and query efficiency.
